# GalacticStore Protocol

GalacticStore is an advanced digital asset storage and container lifecycle management system built on the Stacks blockchain using the Clarity smart contract language.

It enables secure handling of digital containers with features such as time-based expiration, multi-party approvals, emergency protocols, cryptographic validations, and recovery mechanisms.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Container-Based Storage**: Organize digital assets into containers with defined originators and beneficiaries.
- **Lifecycle Controls**: Support for termination, delivery, expiration, and retrieval of containers.
- **Emergency Protocols**: Activate protocol-level emergency handling (e.g., `freeze-all`, `multi-sig-enforcement`).
- **Challenge & Audit**: Challenge container states with formal justification.
- **Signature & Metadata Logs**: Record digital signatures and container-specific metadata.
- **Recovery Options**: Register recovery addresses for contingency access.
- **Frequency Throttling**: Enforce operational rate-limiting per configuration.

    asset-id: uint,
    quantity: uint,
    container-status: (string-ascii 10),
    activation-block: uint,
    expiration-block: uint
  }
